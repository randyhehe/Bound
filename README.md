Green: You, Red: Explosion, Blue: Wall

This is my UCR CS120B Spring 2016 final project. It is based on a popular game mode in Starcraft, Bound, in which the objective is to get to the dodge patterned explosions to get to the other side. 

This game has full level customization for up to 8 levels, with 20 unique patterns for each level. Each pattern has a set duration determining how long it lasts and waits until the next pattern. EEPROM stores all levels, even on poweroff, and brown out detection is enabled to prevent memory glitching with unstable voltages.

The project is described in full detail in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lrzXC5bqX8
